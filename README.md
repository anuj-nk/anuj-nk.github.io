# Astro + React Site

This project has been migrated from a plain React/Vite setup to an [Astro](https://astro.build/) site with React integration.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site is served from `localhost:4321` by Astro.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds the entire Astro site into the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

`npm run deploy` uses `gh-pages` to publish the contents of `dist` to GitHub Pages.
