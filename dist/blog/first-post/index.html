This blog has been a “minor” side project I have been working on this month in my free time. Those who know me will recognize the perplexity in my decision to do this. For one, I am not known as a good writer. At least, writing has never been something I’m particularly good at. Although others who create blogs, especially in the tech industry, use it as a portfolio showcase and a platform to discuss technology, it doesn’t seem entirely necessary to have excellent writing skills to start a blog. But I want to use this platform to discuss a lot more than simply technology (and hopefully improve my writing skills).
<br>
<br>
A little bit about me: I am a 21-year-old incoming graduate student at the University of Washington. I enjoy basketball, music, movies, and many more generic things as well. I have a bachelor’s in Computer Science from Arizona State. Born and brought up in Arizona by two Indian immigrant parents, I am fluent in English.
<br>
<br>
During the pandemic, I decided to start posting tweets on a random Twitter account to just vent my thoughts on an anonymous platform. At first, they were helpful for me to express my thoughts or opinions in ways that were met with no backlash. Eventually, however, the utter silence I received back in response was daunting. Often, the lack of response made me feel more unease than my feelings themselves. Whether it was the algorithm or people intentionally, there was a profound sense of loneliness present with the words I was speaking. That Twitter account is long since deleted.
<br>
<br>
I find that developing my own website gives credence to my word. I mean, who would question the word of a person who can develop this, right? Now, I hope to provide ramblings and expressions of opinions, emotions, and thoughts, and lay them all bare.
<br>
<br>
The reason I started this blog was as a sort of therapy. It’s the reason why I made that Twitter account. At the time, I knew those tweets would never get popular or spark attention. I did it because I wanted a space to just express my opinions, as dumb as they are. It was a really lonely time for me and everyone in the world staying at home. It was no wonder I would gravitate toward such a confusing approach to connection.
<br>
<br>
Now, I don’t make this blog for connection specifically. I am grateful to know people and to have just so many conversations with them. I am making it as a way to just yap and have fun. Talking about things like this in a public space is scary, but no one is gonna read this anyway haha, so who cares. I can yap into the void on a blog with no one to read it. Well, then why didn’t I just do a Substack or journal? As a showcase project for someone to hire me, as I am severely unemployed right now. Although the idea of my yap resonating with people of broad swaths is incredibly exciting to me as well. It’s even more possible with me developing my own site for it. Instead of competing with others online, I compete with only my ability to advertise the site :D. Of course, I would need to improve my writing so people would be interested. For now, I can just yap to my heart’s content.
<br>
<br>
If you think my ideas are interesting or I talk funny, then I have done something that made at least one person have a positive experience. Maybe I made 10 people angry before one person liked it, but it’s okay because at the end of the day it’s just yap. The perfect situation is where people actively engage in the material and respond back to me with comments, concerns, or points. I would love to have that. You can also be sure that my humor will shine through in the posts like an oasis in the distance.
<br>
<br>
For now though, I have to say it’s been a good one. Hopefully, see you in the next blog :)</p> </div> </article>  <footer class="mx-auto flex flex-nowrap items-center gap-x-6 justify-center py-4 bg-stone-200"> <p class="text-xs text-zinc-700 whitespace-nowrap">
