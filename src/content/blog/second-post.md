If you've read my introduction post, this may seem counterintuitive as a second post. I mean I ended the first post about how my humor will seep through into all my posts. Yet, I am writing a post on one a very unhumorous topic. This is just the book I've read and want to discuss. This is my blog, so I get to decide the rules. Second, I was assuming my second post would be something introspective as written about in the first post. However, I find the topic of this book and its contents moving and slightly relevant to my own personal experiences. Although this book is Nonfiction, I would still encourage you to read it completely blind as I have to form your own opinion, or you can read my post and form you rown opinion based on my thoughts as well.

"Everything is Tuberculosis" by John Green is an in-depth deep-dive into the world of tuberculosis, its history, and the ways it permeates through into our modern day. John Green has always had some form of influence in my life. My first introduction to him was when reading "The Fault in Our Stars" and the subsequent movie adaptation. From there, he would appear in my history classrooms in high school teaching me about many aspects of world history on Crash Course. This was partly why I decided to read this book. My history with his work was paramount enough to try reading his new book.
<br>
<br>
This book deals with many heavy subjects in regards to tuberculosis. The main storyline in this book regards a boy named Henry and his struggles with tuberculosis in Sierra Leone. That storyline is intertwined with descriptions of historical and social viewpoints of tuberculosis. Much of the first half of the book centers around how tuberculosis functions and the way society interprets the disease societally. A telling example is the description of the way "consumption" (the term used to refer to tuberculosis) was framed around the 18-19th century. He describes that many referred to consumption as creating an ethereal glow in those who has it as their eyes were sunken, their skin paler, and their body slimer. This, in turn, influenced the way we approached beauty from a western angle up to the modern day. The term "Everything is Tuberculosis" stems from that societal implication of how tuberculosis was viewed and had impacted much of society. Tuberculosis has influenced much of culture from previously mentioned beauty standards to fashion, writing, medicine, and more. 
<br>
<br>
This all leads into the story of Henry and his case of tuberculosis. See, his form of tuberculosis is a drug-resistant variant meaning he needs specialized and more expensive care to cure himself. However, coming from Sierra Leone his family had rarely the funds to support him especcially with his father going in and out of the house. Thus, he stuggled to maintain the expensive care. Eventually, his disease mutated and made it harder to get the proper medicine. Luckily, he had a doctor come in and worked hard to get the specific medications that created an elixir of sort that could cure Henry of his disease. Before his disease was able to kill him, he had been cured of the disease in a miracle to some. His little sister had died when she was young and his friend in the hospital has also died of TB. To go from that to a survivor is a triumph accomplishment.
<br>
<br>
Now, I don't want to bore you by just summarizing the book in totality. There is much I have left out and as such you should go read the book for yourself. It's a great look into humanity and the disease that is the deadliest infectious disease as of 2024. 
<br>
<br>
The smartest thing Green does in this book is juxtapose the story he wants to tell with the history of tuberculosis. In the beginning, context is given as to the plight Henry suffers from. Then, we shift to learning about the history of tuberculosis and the role it has had in the almanac of history. The first half really does keep to the namesake of the book in describing everything that tuberculosis has caused just through its existence. By the middle of the book, we describe the way tuberculosis has shifted from killing almost 1/4 of the population to almost never thought of in the modern world. Yet, why is Henry suffering so much? Green keeps this thought in the back of readers' minds as you learn of the cure for tuberculosis and how much we have accomplished against the disease.
<br>
<br>
The major thesis surrounds how tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease in the world yet somehow we never here about it especially in America. That fact is due to the inadequate healthcare costs in third world countries where the disease runs rampant. Green expresses his frustration with how millions die to tuberculosis each year, yet it seems so obscure even though other infectious diseases such as COVID-19 can cause a worldwide pandemic. He attributes this to a human issue. A societal issue regarding lack of funds, lack of investment, lack of cost-effectiveness. The final closing words of the article read, "In a world where everyone can eat, and access healthcare, and be treated humanely, tuberculosis has no chance. Ultimately, we are the cause. We must also be the cure."
<br>
<br>
There is rightful frustration to some of the practices mentioned in the book. For instance, price gouging of medicines causes third-world countries who need medicine for tuberculosis cannot afford such medicines. There is also rightful frustration when tuberculosis is seen as a shameful disease to have in certain areas of Western Africa as shown by Henry's distant family and friends abandoning him after he contracts the illness. This is ultimately assigning societal and economical value for a disease that does not concern about any of these things. That is why Green states that we are the cause. Many things such as sanitation, access to medication, education, and more are things that we as a society can dictate the directives on. 
<br>
<br>
I'm no economist, but this consensus seems logical from an initial glance. I mean the human perspective in me sees how an injustice like this can be equally as frustrating and depressing. You, as the reader, gain an attachment to Henry by way of his story. It's hard to disagree with an author that's stance is against the deaths of millions of people. At the end of the day, beauracracy is something that we as humans invented to maintain the way we solve our problems. 
<br>
<br>
This book and many other readings recently have given me a better scope into the way the world works. Lots of times, governments and corporations of power have only a goal of allocating their resources to best accomplish their goals. You can see this with the recent bill passed by the president. You can see this in how companies describe their quarterly earnings and business strategies. Going off that, the next book I have to read is "Abundance" by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. I bought this book to see a perspective in how we can best strategize that allocation of money. "Everything is Tuberculosis" was a suprise in how it explores that idea in a much more human perspective. It's a deep introspection into the system we create and how they cause major acts of injustice. Yet, these same systems are what develop the innovations that create the cures for this disease in the first place. 
<br>
<br>
So do we blame the system itself? No, I don't think we do and neither does Green. The issue is in the humans who litigate the system. Again, we are what we make of the things around us. At the end of the day, we created everything that society has to offer. The good and the bad exist in constant perpetuity of one another. Thus, we needs calls to action like this book to help steer our focus. Green doesn't point out any individual bad actors who have caused this (except J&J who made that unnecessarily overpriced drug which directly kills hundreds of thousands of people). It's a collective miasma of thought which can cause a tide and suffocate those without proper bearings. This book is a step towards shifting the tide towards something which seeks positive change in the world of Tuberculosis, and I'm all here for it.

So, this was a fun one to write. Felt like one of those video essay Youtubers. This discussion got decently off-topic from the subject of Tuberculosis specifically. Maybe everything is tuberculosis <em>wink wink ;)</em>. I hope you enjoyed, and hopefully points don't sound narcissistic or uninformed. I mean I am very uninformed, but I try my best. Well, I will see you next time. <strong>Bye</strong>
