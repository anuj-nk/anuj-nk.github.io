“I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.” ― Jerome K. Jerome

Life Update! As my actual third post, I will be talking about my journey to becoming a graduate student at the University of Washington. I also want to keep this true to my actual thoughts and communicate with candor and authenticity.
<br><br>
Oh goodness, where do I even begin? My introduction post was almost two months ago now at this point. I wrote that introduction the first day I landed In New York. Since then, I came back to Arizona and have now moved to Seattle. It will be the first time I have moved outside of my home state. I'm a very fresh young buck in the crowd. Graduate school is also a first as I am starting school after almost 4 months of nothing. First impressions are good for sure. The city is lively and green. My commute is beautiful through the bridge over the lake. I can't ask for more except maybe not going into debt. 
<br><br>
Alongside going into debt, a big worry many in my situation have is the profound loneliness one can feel in a big city where you know no one. I am fortuntate enough to have family in the city. I also have 3 other roomates who don't seem immediately hostile haha. Relationships with people at my graduate school are also a possibility. Actualy, the school is encouraging networking amongst students, faculty, and anyone that steps through the building doors. I, however, suck at networking. I have always been bad at it. Optimistically, that's the reason I am in school, to learn how to properly network. On one hand, I know how to make friends and keep relationships with people I know. On the other hand, I don't have a full grasp on what networking truly is. It is hard to discern it from just random banter or chit chat. I am a type of person who dislikes superficial friendship connections. Networking is difficult as it forces me to try and connect with someone in such a short period of time. I feel that I can't connect or understand a person in that time. Is there networking that doesn't involve such sparse interaction? Maybe? We have to wait and see.
<br><br>
Lonliness and Socializing are not what's at the forefront of my mind. It's about my upcoming workload. The amount of work that is going to pile onto me feels astronomical. I fear that my classes will be very difficult as a graduate course. I fear that this alongside my need to get a part-time job is going to add more weight. I fear that the need to network and find internships is going to consume my life. I fear that my hobbies of playing games, sports, and other recreational activities will have to cease completely. Now, that last fear is completely superficial and definitely sounds a bit spoiled. Sadly, the recreational activities I do are a part of me. So, it feels like losing a bit of me with that. Conversely, this amount of work is exciting for a young person. My mind is a sponge for information right now. If there is any time to delve into this kind of work ethic, it should be now. I should be reading, learning, and actively engaging with as many things as I can. If my recreational activities don't do anything to support my future life outlook, then they aren't something I need to focus on.

On brighter news, the food looks excellent in Seattle. I can't wait to try. My room is also very spacious with many things walking distance from me. My car is also there in case I need to get anything that might be a distance away. My time also feels much more finite which causes me to think like it's a video game day and night system. I'm trying to get as much stuff as I can get done in a day without expending my stamina bar. It's a pretty exciting gameplay loop compared to having nothing to do. I have some books I need to read. I said I would be reading Abundance which may or may not happen in the next two months. I will be reading Atomic Habits, though. The work I seem to be doing at graduate school seems very exciting, and I hope to continue that into my job prospects. I think I would rather be exhausted doing something I enjoy than well rested doing something I dislike. Well, only time can really tell. I might be too young to understand what lies in front of me. All I can do is just experience it.

Please let me know if my work made you laugh. If it did, I am thinking of starting my comedy career. My first joke will be something to do with airplane food.
