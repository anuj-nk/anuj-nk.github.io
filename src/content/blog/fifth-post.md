As the title and description imply, the FTC has ordered Amazon to pay a total of $2.5 billion in redress and civil penalties for its improper handling of Prime memberships. This ruling responds to Amazon’s predatory practices misleading consumers into purchasing Prime subscriptions and deliberately making it difficult to cancel them. It’s the latest in a series of cases where the FTC has sought to stop exploitative corporate behavior. A notable example is Ticketmaster, where the FTC found that the company failed to enforce purchase limits, allowing scalpers to drive up prices on the resale market.

I’ve only recently begun paying closer attention to the FTC’s actions in antitrust cases and efforts to increase fair competition in open markets. From everything I’ve read, this Amazon case is an unequivocal win for consumer rights. During the previous administration, the FTC worked on a “Click to Cancel” rule that would make canceling a subscription as easy as signing up for one. Pushback from corporations and subsequent lawsuits delayed the rule, which finally went into effect in July of this year. The current FTC administration seems to be carrying that momentum forward. This Amazon order shows a continued commitment to the consumer protection work the FTC has pursued since 2021.

From a Human–Computer Interaction perspective, user interfaces should prioritize clarity and ease of use. This benefits both users and companies: users can understand the site more quickly, and companies keep visitors engaged because the experience is seamless. But financial incentives can distort this balance. Amazon is one example; Frontier Airlines is another. Frontier attracts users with low fares, but its site is filled with pop-ups and confusing design intended to steer customers toward add-ons and upgrades. While manipulative, this isn’t fully predatory. Users still get genuinely cheaper base fares, and the site doesn’t prevent them from completing their main goal of booking flights. Amazon’s case is different. Its interface was intentionally designed to confuse users and discourage cancellation, which violates trust. Frontier makes it difficult to purchase; Amazon made it difficult to leave.

Overall, the current FTC board is still young, but it appears to be charting a middle ground between deregulation and strategic enforcement. This contrasts with the previous administration under Lina Khan, which leaned heavily into antitrust actions that some considered overly aggressive. The Amazon case is a positive step, but I worry that other industries may be left without enough regulation to keep them in check. Under Khan, the opposite was true; almost every merger, even minor ones, seemed to invite scrutiny or potential breakup orders. That approach arguably pushed beyond the FTC’s traditional scope and risked stifling growth.

The key takeaway is that even in a case as clear-cut as Amazon’s, partisan politics continue to color perceptions. I’m encouraged that the FTC remains focused on consumer protection, and I’m glad to see broad agreement across administrations on what constitutes unfair competitive practices. The differences lie in execution and methodology. In spite of the political noise, Amazon facing meaningful consequences for manipulative design is a win. It’s a necessary pushback against harmful corporate practices and a step toward a healthier digital landscape.
