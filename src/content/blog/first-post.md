Welcome! This blog has been a "minor" side project I have been working on this month in my free time. Those who know me will recognize the perplexity in my decision to do is. For one, I am not known as a good writer. At least, writing has never been something I'm particularly good at. Although, others who create blogs especially in the Tech industry use it as a portfolio showcase and a platform to discuss technology, so it doesn't seem entirely necessary to need excellent writing skills to start a blog. But, I want to use this platform to discuss a lot more than simply technology (and hopefully improve my writing skills). 
<br>
<br>
A little bit about me. I am a 21 year old incoming Graduate Student at the University of Washington. I enjoy Basketball, Music, Movies, and much more generic things as well. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Arizona State. Born and brought up in Arizona from two Indian immigrant parents. I am fluent in English.

During the pandemic, I decided to start posting tweets on a random Twitter account to just vent my thoughts in an anonymous platform. At first, they were helpful at me just expressing my thoughts or opinions in ways that were met with no backlash. Eventually, however, the utter silence I recieved back in response was daunting. Often, the lack of response made me feel more unease than my feelings themselves. Thankfully, all those tweets and messages are all gone now. I deleted them. People had rightfully ignored these tweets as ramblings of a teenager cooped up in their room for too long, and it's hard to argue with that.
<br>
<br>
I find that developing my own website gives credence to my word. I mean, who would question the word of a person that can develop this, right? Starting a blog was just the next evolution of that! Now, I hope to just provide ramblings and expressions of opinions, emotions, thoughts, and lay them all bare. 
<br>
<br>
The reason I started this blog was as a sort of therapy. It's the reason why I made that Twitter account. At the time, I knew those tweets would never get popular or spark attention. I did it because I wanted a space to just express my opinions as dumb as they are. It was a really lonely time for me and everyone in the world staying at home. It was no wonder I would gravitate towards such a confusing approach towards connection. 
<br>
<br>
Now, I don't make this blog for connection. I am grateful to know people and have conversations with them. I am making it as a way to just yap and have fun. Talking about things like this in a public space is scary, but no one is gonna read this anyway haha, so who cares. I can yap into the void on a blog with no one to read it. Well, then why didn't I just do like a substack or journal? The idea of my yap resonating with people of broad swaths is incredibly exciting to me. It's even more possible with me developing my own site for it. Instead of competing with others online, I compete with only my ability to advertise the site :D. Of course, I would need to improve my writing so people would be interested. For now, I can just yap to my hearts content. Also, this website can be used as a project showcase to get me a job.
<br>
<br>
If you think my ideas are interesting or I talk funny, then I have done something which made at least one person have a positive experience. Maybe I made 10 people angry before one person likes it, but it's okay because at the end of the day it's just yap. The perfect situation is where people actively engage in the material and respond back to me with comments, concerns, or points. I would love to have that.
<br>
<br>
For now though, I have to say it's been a good one. Hopeflly, see you in the next blog :)
