Here I have provided the Github Repo for all the documentation for the code for this project. I have also provided a video demo of the project working as a game.

To go into more detail, this game is an Arcade-style spaceship game where you have to do one of four actions while controlling an imaginary spaceship's wheel. That's why it uses language such as Bank Left/Right or Nose Up/Down. You can imagine that the wheel is an extension of the actual space ship with the nose of the ship jutting out from the backside of the device. Of couse, this is something that can be done to improve the aesthetic of the game in the future. 

The specifics of how the game works are all in the Github Repo.
